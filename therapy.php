      <em>Hope  for those with severe and chronic health conditions! </em><br />
      </p>
      <p align="center">Chi Therapy is an ancient health recovery therapy proven over thousands of  years that emphasizes using energy (Chi) to help a participant recover from  illness in a rapid and effective manner. The therapy utilizes the Chinese  Medical Paradigm which emphasizes the restoration of a smooth flow of energy in  a person to achieve health.Â  Specifically  the energy blockages that are causing the participantâ?Ts illness are removed and  a healthy energy flow is restored.Â  The  therapist will open the participantâ?Ts relevant energy points then transmit and  promote energy (<strong>Chi</strong>) flow throughout the body and specific area(s). The participantâ?Ts  treatment will be accompanied by a specific and tailored prescription of follow  up Chi Kung exercises to enhance and assist the recovery.Â  The benefits and results are remarkable. <br />
        </p>
      <p align="center">Chi Therapy usually requires up to 6 one hour sessions that may be  weekly, every two weeks, monthly or by a schedule dictated by both the need and  availability of the participant and therapist.Â    After the first  session an estimate on the number of sessions required will be given but keep  in mind it is an estimate and may not be accurate due to speed of progress made  by the participant.Â  <br />
        </p>
      <p align="center">Chi Therapy is appropriate for a myriad number of conditions and especially for  those suffering <strong>pain</strong>.Â  Please contact us via the course application  (Alex, please insert the link here) to inquire about the suitability of your  condition for Chi Therapy.Â  Please state  that you are inquiring about Chi Therapy.<br />
        </p>
      <p align="center">No special diet or herbal supplements are required with Chi Therapy and  lifestyle restrictions are rare.Â  <br />
        </p>
      <p align="center">If one is already receiving Medical Treatment for a condition Chi Therapy is  a fantastic complement to enhance recovery.Â  <br />
        </p>
      <p align="center">Please consider that the most important element of recovery is the participantâ?Ts  adherence to the twice daily follow up practice of Chi Kung exercises  specifically prescribed for the participantâ?Ts condition.Â  This involves 15 minute practice sessions  each morning and evening.Â  You will be  trained in how to practice successfully on your own.Â  The practice is easy and enjoyable.<br />

        </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>What is so special about your Chi  Therapy?</strong><br />
        </p>
      <p align="center">Chi Therapy provided by Sifu Anthony Spinicchia is very special by  comparison to other therapies.Â  Our Chi  Therapy utilizes Shaolin Wahnam Chi Kung which is famous for being the best and  most effective Chi Kung available.Â   Shaolin Arts are famous throughout history as being the best.Â  Shaolin Wahnam Chi Kung is a distillation of  the best of Shaolin Chi Kung to make it even more direct and effective while  also being safe.Â  Our Chi Therapy is  provided by Sifu Anthony Spinicchia who is specially trained by Shaolin  Grandmaster Wong Kiew Kit to perform these services.Â  Sifu Anthony continues to refine the  effectiveness of his practice under the direct guidance of Grandmaster  Wong.Â  Sifu Anthony is an inner chamber  disciple of Grandmaster Wong.<br />
        </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>What is the difference in Chi Therapy  sessions with Sifu Anthony and simply taking one of his regular classes or  seminars?</strong>Â  <br />
        </p>
      <p align="center">Both are very effective but Chi Therapy is very direct in targeting the  condition and has the added benefits of direct opening of energy points and  transmission of Chi to the participant.Â   Also a custom Chi Kung practice is prescribed and taught to the  participant.Â  Chi Therapy sessions  involve direct Chi transmission, training and follow up practice.Â  In regular classes and seminars ample time is  available and allotted for discussion of Chi Kung philosophy, guidelines, life  application, etc.Â  There is no time for  this in Chi Therapy sessions thus this is generally not provided.Â  Participants receive clear instruction and  guidance in how to perform their daily follow up practice.Â  All they have to do is practice as  instructed.</p>
